# Usage



Texture supports editing XML files in [JATS](https://jats.nlm.nih.gov/archiving/1.1/) XML standard.



* After plugin installation,  go to a `Production Stage` of the submission

* Upload JATS XML to the  `Production Ready` state. You can find sample files [blank manuscript](https://github.com/substance/texture/tree/master/data/blank) or a [list of samples](https://github.com/substance/texture/tree/master/data/) here.

![production_ready_edit](docs/production_ready_edit.png)

* All the uploaded images in texture are integrated as dependent files in production ready stage.

* When you later publish the texture-edited JATS XML file as galley, you have to upload the images **again** in the dependancy grid.

![gallery_edit](docs/galley_edit.png)

* In the editing modal, upload the same images as dependent files you uploaded for texture.

  * Parameters: 

    1. `submissionId` : integer

    2. `fileId` : integer

    3. `stageId` : integer 

  * Return:

     `DAR File` : json

    * Example:

        ```json

          {"version":18,"resources":{"manifest.xml":{"encoding":"utf8","data":"XML PAYLOAD","size":22087,"createdAt":0,"updatedAt":0},"placeholder_2.jpg":{"encoding":"url","data":"http://localhost:8000/index.php/stable-3_2_0/texture/media?submissionId=4&fileId=29&stageId=5&fileName=placeholder_2.jpg","size":39385,"createdAt":1592229618,"updatedAt":1592229618},"coverimage_2.png":{"encoding":"url","data":"http://localhost:8000/index.php/stable-3_2_0/texture/media?submissionId=4&fileId=29&stageId=5&fileName=coverimage_2.png","size":48334,"createdAt":1594576206,"updatedAt":1594576206}}}

        ```
