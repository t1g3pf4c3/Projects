# Abstract 

## Objective
Telemetry equipment detectors
Telemetry is the use of electrical and electronic equipment for detecting, collecting and processing physical data, and relaying them to a particular receiving station.
The article deals with issues of using electrical and electronic equipment for detecting, collecting and processing physical data, and relaying them to a particular receiving station. It focuses on relativity of the matter of distance in telemetry and outlines the range of telemetry users. The article identifies the coding techniques and parameters of the equipment used in any telemetric system.

## Methods
The coding techniques used are commonly digital.
In any telemetric system, the equipment used must be able to make a measurement of a physical quantity, produce and relay a signal.

## Conclusions
The matter of distance in telemetry is relative. Telemetry is used for running tests of engines, for detecting flaws and changing conditions in industrial systems, or for obtaining data from dangerously radioactive sites. Meteorologists make use of a wide range of telemetric devices to obtain information from the upper atmosphere for use in making their weather forecasts.
